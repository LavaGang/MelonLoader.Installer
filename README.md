## How does it work?
The installer should automatically list installed Unity games on your machine.

### Supported game launchers on Windows
- Steam
- Epic Games Store
- GOG

### Supported game launchers on Linux
- Steam

### Games from unsupported launchers
If the game you're trying to mod isn't listed, you can locate it manually by clicking on the `Add Game Manually` button.

### MelonLoader Installation
To install MelonLoader, click on the game you wish to mod. Next, select your preferred version and hit the big `Install` button.

### Nightly builds
